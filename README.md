# 🎮 Smart Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Java and OOP

A console-based, intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against an AI opponent using Java. This project applies core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and decision-making algorithms to make gameplay smart and structured.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project aims to:
- Build an interactive and smart Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Integrate AI logic to make decisions.
- Practice and demonstrate OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay
- Option to choose who plays first
- Turn-based system with clear display
- Win and draw detection logic
- Clean and maintainable OOP structure

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** None (Standard Java)
- **Database:** Not applicable

---

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation:** Game data is hidden and accessed through methods
- **Inheritance:** (Future scope) Can extend for Human/AI player types
- **Polymorphism:** Used via method overloading/overriding
- **Abstraction:** AI and game logic separated from game loop
