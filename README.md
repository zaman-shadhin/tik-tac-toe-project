1. Project Title:
Smart Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Java and OOP

2. Purpose of the Project:
This project aims to develop an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against an AI opponent.
It solves the problem of rule-based games by integrating decision-making using algorithm.
OOP principles enhance the maintainability, scalability, and structure of the codebase, making the game reusable.

3. Project Objectives and Key Functionalities:
 •	Objectives:
   1.	Implement a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game.
   2.	Incorporate AI opponent logic using algorithm.
   3.	Apply core OOP principles for clean architecture.
 •	Key Functionalities:
   1.	Human vs AI gameplay.
   2.	Option to choose who plays first.
   3.	Turn-based move system.
   4.	Win/draw detection logic.
   5.	Clean display of the board after each turn.

4. Technologies Used:
  •	Programming Language: Java
  •	Frameworks/Libraries: None (Standard Java)
  •	Database: Not required for this version

5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Used:
  •	Encapsulation: Board data and player data are protected; access via methods.
  •	Inheritance: (If expanded) Could be used for different types of players (Human, AI).
  •	Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding can be used in input handling or player types.
  •	Abstraction: Complex logic is hidden from main game flow.

6. Project Phases and Timeline:
  Phase 	  Description	                   Estimated                               Time
Phase 1 – Planning               	Define features and structure                 	  1 day
Phase 2 – Basic Game Logic	      Board design, turn system, win/draw ch eck        2 days
Phase 3 – AI Integration	        Implement algorithm	                              1 day
Phase 4 – Testing                	Debugging and edge case handling	                2 days
Phase 5 – Documentation	          comments, future improvements	                    1 day

7. Final Product and User Benefits:
   The final product is a fully functional, smart, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.
User Benefits:
  •	Fun and challenging game against an AI.
  •	Useful for learning game AI and OOP implementation.

8. Summary and Project Impact:
This project blends fun, logic, and OOP design to build an intelligent game in Java.
It demonstrates practical application of algorithms and object-oriented design, providing both educational and entertainment value.
It serves as a nice step toward more complex AI and game development.
